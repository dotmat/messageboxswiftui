# messageboxswiftui
MessageBox App, written in SwiftUI

## What is MessageBox?
MessageBox is an messaging platform I built while at Twilio, in short its a 2nd line app that lets you provision Twilio based telephone numbers for sending/recieving SMS messages and making/reciveing telephone calls.

The app also features a WhatsApp style chat service where you can chat with other 'MessageBoxers', Direct IP chat contains richer features than SMS such as;
- typing indicators
- voice & video calling
- media sharing

## Why SwiftUI?
These apps are not for commercial use and so Im using them to teach myself new coding styles and languages. 

###### Extras
The app also features a 'Debug' Mode which when enabled allows customer support to track whats going on with the app and where bugs are being encountered.
- By default this feature is not enabled and only needs to be if you are having trouble using the service.
